# VRPortalToolkit
By Daniel Ablett, Andrew Cunningham, Gun Lee and Bruce Thomas

A toolkit for portals in Unity, specifically intended for virtual reality. Portal rendering is implemented using Unity's Universal Render Pipeline (URP) and does **not** require custom shaders for objects. This toolkit was designed to be easily added to existing projects with minimal effort. This toolkit supports:
* Multi-pass and single-pass stereo
* Stencil and render texture portals
* "Infinite" recursion
* Optimised culling through portals

Made with Unity 2020.3.32f1.
